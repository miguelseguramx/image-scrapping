# Image Scrapping

This is a small CLI utility to download all the images from a website

I create this project because I need all the images from marvel.com to create my project: [Marvel Clone](https://github.com/miguelseguramx/marvel-react)

## How to use

Run the comand `npm start` with two parameters

- The URL of the page from which you want to retrieve all the images
- The path where they will be saved

*As Example*

`npm start https://marvel-msx.netlify.app/ ./img`
